The tool uses TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to measure relevance between CV content and job requirements. It highlights missing keywords, shows a circular relevance meter, and supports both PDF and TXT uploads. The UI is designed with PyQt5 for an interactive and user-friendly experience.

This project helped me apply core machine learning concepts in a practical, real-world setting, particularly focusing on NLP and document similarity.
